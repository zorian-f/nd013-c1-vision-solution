### Project overview
In this First Project the Task is to train and evaluate a pretrained modle from the [TensorFlow 2 Detection Model Zoo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/tf2_detection_zoo.md). The [Waymo Open dataset](https://waymo.com/open/) is used as a datasource.
The Original starter code can be found at [udacity/nd013-c1-vision-starter](https://github.com/udacity/nd013-c1-vision-starter) and the original Problem instructions can be found in the [README_ORIG.md](README_ORIG.md). The modle is trained to detect vehicles, pedestrians and cyclists in an urban environment.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In the EDA we get a better understanding of the Data we are dealing with. The first thing implented is a simple script which shows 10 random picked pictures off of one tfRecord file.
